      <p>Los Angeles-based composer, guitarist, and pianist Mark Charles Smithâ€™s works have been performed in diverse venues across the United States, including the Guitar Foundation of America (GFA) Festival, Lincoln Center, and Eastern Music Festival, as well as in Spain, Canada, Australia, and Iceland.<br /><br /> Recent concert highlights include the North American premiere of his composition "We Are All In This Together" for guitar soloist with guitar ensemble by Grammy-award winning guitarist Jason Vieaux at the Eastern Music Festival, with additional performances in Iceland, North Carolina, and at Zion National Park in Utah.  Summer 2022 saw the Spanish premiere of the piece, featuring soloist Xavier Jara with the United States Guitar Orchestra, under the baton of Dr. Kami Rowan.<br /><br />Mark is keenly interested in artistic collaboration between different media, and has worked extensively with choreographer Abigail Wallace (Small Creatures Dance Company) to create work.  Their most recent collaboration, Light Exists, an improvisation-driven exploration of deconstruction, reappropriation, and the interface between dance, music, and visual art, was featured at The Athenaeum in Alexandria, VA. </p>
